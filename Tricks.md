## Tricks.
1. Median of an arr/string.
```cpp
int m=n/2+1;
```
2. Find out how many item within a range.
```cpp
int c=lastIn-firstIn+1;
```
3. If the last digit of any number is even then the whole number is even.
4. Lexicographical order(dictionary order) of number means any possible order will be valid.
